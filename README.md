#Homework Repository

This is my homework repo for STAT 545A course, where I will organise the five assignments for the course in five different folders called hw01, hw02, hw03, hw04 and hw05. You can navigate to the folders through the links provided in the table below. These folders will be updated close to the due date of the assignment
